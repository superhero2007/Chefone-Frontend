      <p>
        Chef.one UG (haftungsbeschränkt), Alstertwiete 1B, 20099 Hamburg entered
        in the Commercial Register of the District Court of Hamburg-Mitte under
        HRB 140672 (hereinafter: Chef.one) operates an online market platform
        and in particular an application for mobile end devices. A usage
        contract is concluded between the users of the online platform and/or
        the application and Chef.one, which includes these Terms and Conditions
        (hereinafter: TCs).
      </p>
      <p>
        Meals and drinks (hereinafter: food) prepared by persons can be offered
        (hereinafter: chefs) and purchased (hereinafter: guests) on the
        platform. Users may also use the platform to organize and get together
        for a joint cooking event (hereinafter: events).
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>Chefs and guests are hereinafter jointly referred to as "users".</p>
      <p>
        Chef.one does not offer any food or organize any events itself. Chef.one
        is explicitly not a contractual partner for the contracts that are
        concluded exclusively between the users of the platform. The individual
        users are responsible for satisfying these contractual obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chef.one does not accept any liability for content provided by users.
        Content provided by users does not reflect the opinion of Chef.one.
        Chef.one does not appropriate the content provided on the platform by
        users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chef.one is entitled to edit users' content so that it can be viewed on
        mobile end devices (smartphones) or Chef.one software applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use of the Chef.one app and all features is subject to the provision
        that users act in accordance with the{' '}
        <a href="https://chefone.zendesk.com/hc/en-us">Chef.one Guidelines</a>
        . Chef.one is entitled to modify the organization of its platform
        insofar as this is reasonable for users in consideration of the
        legitimate interests of Chef.one.
      </p>
      <p>Section 2 Registration </p>
      <ol>
        <li>General</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Users register for Chef.one by opening an account and agreeing to these
        TCs and the{' '}
        <a href="https://chef.one/privacy">data protection provisions</a>
        . Registration is only possible if users expressly confirm that they
        acknowledge and agree to the TCs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Minors cannot register for Chef.one. Chef.one reserves the right to make
        registration dependent on proof of identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        A contract is concluded between users and Chef.one on usage of the
        platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users are obliged to update their stored data without delay should this
        data change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users shall ensure that their accounts are not misused by third parties.
        If users suspect that this may be the case, they shall inform Chef.one
        of this without delay.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Registration on the app</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In the first instance, the Chef.one app, which is available from the
        Apple Store and the Google Play Store, must be downloaded. The software
        required for the download and its update status can be found in the
        description of the app on the App Store.
      </p>
      <p>
        One way to register is via a Facebook link embedded in the app. To this
        end, new users click on the button reading 'Facebook', which takes them
        to the Facebook login screen where they enter their Facebook login
        details (email address or cellphone number and Facebook password). The
        'Register' button will become clickable once the prerequisite
        confirmation of acknowledgment of the TCs and data protection provisions
        has been provided ("checkbox"). Following the successful entry of their
        Facebook login details and confirmation of acknowledgment of the TCs and
        data protection provisions, users return to the Chef.one application
        after clicking the 'Register' button and can then use the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another option for users to register is to open an account by entering
        their first and last names, email address and a selected password. The
        'Create Account' button will become clickable once new users have
        confirmed that they acknowledge the TCs and data protection provisions
        by clicking the checkbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the successful entry of their data and acknowledgment and
        confirmation of the TCs and data protection provisions, users can select
        if they are vegetarians, vegans or omnivores. Following this selection
        the registration process is complete and the platform can be used.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Registration on the website</li>
      </ol>
      <p>

        <a href="https://www.chef.one/">https://www.chef.one/</a> in the same
        manner as outlined under Section 2 (2).
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Chef Account</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        All registered users also have the option to open a chef account via the
        'become a chef' application. To this end, users send an email with their
        request to <a href="mailto:become@chef.one">become@chef.one</a> via the
        app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chef.one reserves the right to modify the technical means to open a chef
        account or set up an event.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chef.one reviews the user's request and the plausibility of the
        information. Following a successful review, the user shall receive a
        confirmation email from Chef.one, indicating that the chef account can
        now be used.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Chef.one reserves the right to modify the registration process in light
        of technical and legal developments.
      </p>
      <p>Section 3 Use of the Chef.one Platform</p>
      <p>
        Chefs undertake not to offer food that cannot be sold legally. In
        particular, chefs undertake not to offer food where the offer of such
        would breach food regulations.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Users undertake to exclusively use pictures that do not violate
        third-party rights and that provide a true reflection of the food
        offered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users undertake to interact with each other respectfully and to observe
        the{' '}
        <a href="https://chefone.zendesk.com/hc/en-us">Chef.one Guidelines</a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Chefs that offer food or events to consumers in the exercise of their
        trade are obliged to observe statutory regulations, provide mandatory
        consumer protection information and duly inform consumers of the
        existence or non-existence of the statutory right of revocation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chefs are obliged to notify Chef.one if they are acting in the exercise
        of their trade.
      </p>
      <p>Section 4 Right of Revocation for Arranged Contracts</p>
      <p>
        Chef.one emphasizes that the right of revocation pursuant to Section 312
        g (2) sentence 1 no. 2 and no. 9 of the German Civil Code (BGB) can
        usually be excluded for food and events provided by chefs. Chefs are
        responsible for reviewing if contracts are subject to exemptions in this
        respect insofar as they act as contractors within the meaning of Section
        14 BGB. If contracts are not subject to exemptions, chefs undertake to
        duly inform the guest about the right of revocation.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>Section 5 Right of Revocation for the Platform Usage Contract</p>
      <p>Instruction on the Right of Revocation</p>
      <p>
        The following applies to users who are consumers within the meaning of
        Section 13 BGB in respect of the platform usage contract concluded with
        Chef.one:
      </p>
      <p>Right of Revocation</p>
      <p>
        You are entitled to revoke this contract within fourteen days without
        giving any reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        The revocation period is fourteen days and starts on the day the
        contract is concluded.
      </p>
      <p>
        To exercise your right of revocation, you must notify us of your
        decision to revoke this contract by making a clear declaration by post,
        telephone or email (e.g. a letter sent by post, fax or email). You may
        use the enclosed sample revocation form for this purpose, however this
        is not mandatory.
      </p>
      <p>
        The revocation period shall be considered observed if the notification
        of the exercise of the right of revocation is sent before the revocation
        period expires.
      </p>
      <p>Consequences of Revocation</p>
      <p>
        If you revoke this contract, we must reimburse you all payments that we
        have received from you, including delivery costs (excluding additional
        costs resulting from the selection of a delivery method other than the
        cost-effective standard delivery that we offer), without delay and no
        later than within fourteen days after the day on which we receive the
        notification of your revocation of this contract. We use the same means
        of payment for the reimbursement that you used in the original
        transaction, unless expressly agreed otherwise with you. Under no
        circumstances will you be charged fees on account of this reimbursement.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you requested that the service provision commence during the
        revocation period, you must pay us an appropriate amount that
        corresponds to the proportion of the services rendered up to the time
        that you inform us of your exercise of the right of revocation in
        relation to this contract compared to the overall scope of the services
        planned in the contract.
      </p>

      <p>Section 6 Conclusion of Contract</p>
      <p>
        The contract between the chef and the guest is concluded as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        The chef post constitutes an non-binding invitation to name an offer,
        containing the amount of food or spaces for the event in addition to at
        least the following information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Description of the food or event</li>
        <li>Price per portion/item/quantity</li>
        <li>Collection location/terms of delivery</li>
        <li>Collection period/delivery period</li>
        <li>Price of the event</li>
        <li>Time of the event</li>
        <li>Number of participants</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The guest makes a legally binding offer by clicking on the 'Book Now' or
        'Buy Now' button and selecting the subsequent information on the amount
        of food or the desired number of persons.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>Chef.one accepts the offer on behalf and in the name of the chefs.</p>
      <p>
        Upon receipt of a confirmation Email from Chef.one send to the guest the
        contract between the chef and the guest is concluded.
      </p>
      <p>
        The price of the food or event is the final price including any sales
        tax and other price components.
      </p>
      <p>Section 7 Payment</p>
      <p>
        Payment is made in advance immediately after booking using the payment
        option offered by the chef on the platform and selected by the guest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the chef confirms the booking, the guest shall receive an email
        with the details of the service provision.
      </p>
      <p>Chef.one accepts the payment on behalf of the chef.</p>
      <p>Section 8 Evaluation</p>
      <p>
        Users are subject to an evaluation system which can be viewed by other
        users. After an arranged contract has been executed, users can evaluate
        the service by assigning ratings and leaving reviews. A rating is given
        by awarding a maximum of 5 hearts. The more hearts are awarded, the
        better the guest found the service. The review allows users to
        additionally provide details on the service, the chef, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users are reminded to submit an evaluation after the contract has been
        executed.
      </p>
      <p>
        All users are aware of the significance of evaluations. Users only
        submit evaluations that reflect their actual experience. The evaluation
        must always be factual, truthful and based on the product or service.
        Users may be asked by Chef.one to give their view on other users'
        objections. If no view is given within seven working days, Chef.one
        reserves the right to delete the evaluation.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>Section 9 Users' Liability</p>
      <p>
        Liability, on whatever legal grounds, is limited to intent and gross
        negligence in the relationship between the chef and the guest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Liability is otherwise limited to damage resulting from loss of life,
        bodily injury, or damage to health and damage resulting from the
        violation of a principal contractual obligation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event that a material contractual duty (cardinal duty) is
        breached, liability is limited to compensation for the foreseeable,
        typical damage for the party concerned. This also applies to the
        personal liability of employees, representatives and vicarious agents.
      </p>
      <p>
        The regulations of the German Product Liability Act (ProdHaftG) remain
        unaffected.
      </p>
      <p>Section 10 Limitation of the Liability of Chef.one</p>
      <p>
        Chef.one is liable in accordance with statutory provisions for intent
        and gross negligence on the part of Chef.one, its legal representatives,
        executives and other vicarious agents.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        This also applies to the assumption of guarantees or other strict
        liability and in the case of claims in accordance with the Product
        Liability Act or culpable loss of life, bodily injury, or damage to
        health.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Chef.one is not liable for damage caused by disruptions in the
        platform's availability or other technical problems, unless the
        disruption or technical problems are the result of intent or gross
        negligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on the merits of the individual case, Chef.one is liable for
        simple negligent violations of material contractual duties (cardinal
        duties) caused by Chef.one, its representatives, executives or simple
        vicarious agents, thus duties on the performance upon which the user
        relies and is justified in relying for the proper execution of the
        contract. In such a case, however, this liability is restricted to
        foreseeable damage typical of this type of contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        Insofar as the liability of Chef.one is excluded or limited, this is
        also the case for the personal liability of its legal representatives,
        executives and simple vicarious agents.
      </p>
      <p />
      <p>
        Chef.one accepts no guarantee for the quantity or quality of the meals
        and events or other services provided by users on the platform.
      </p>
      <p>Section 11 Fees</p>
      <p>
        Chef.one collects a fee from chefs for brokering the contracts concluded
        on the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        The amount of the fee is based on the current fee schedule. The fee
        schedule can be found{' '}
        <a href="file:///C:\Dokumente%20und%20Einstellungen\DTuac\Eigene%20Dateien\GroupWise\Insert%20link%20to%20fee%20schedule">
          here
        </a>
        or at chef.one/fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chef.one reserves the right to waive the collection of a fee for special
        events and special periods.
      </p>
      <p>Users shall be notified in advance of changes to the fee schedule.</p>
      <p />
      <p>Section 12 Blocking, Termination</p>
      <p>
        Chef.one shall temporarily or permanently exclude users from using the
        platform if they repeatedly violate the{' '}
        <a href="https://chefone.zendesk.com/hc/en-us">Chef.one Guidelines</a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        This usage contract can be terminated by users at any time following the
        satisfaction of all payment obligations vis-à-vis other users or
        vis-à-vis Chef.one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chef.one may terminate this usage contract at any time in observance of
        a notice period of 14 days to the end of the month.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a user has been blocked or the usage contract terminated, the user
        may no longer use the Chef.one platform or re-register.
      </p>
      <p>
        The termination of the usage contract or the blocking of an account does
        not affect the contracts concluded between users.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>Section 13 Release</p>
      <p>
        Users release Chef.one from all claims that other users or other third
        parties assert against Chef.one due to the violation of their rights by
        food, events or content offered or provided by users on the Chef.one
        platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users hereby assume the costs of any legal defense required by Chef.one,
        including all court and attorney fees in the statutory amount. This does
        not apply if the user is not responsible for the violation. Users are
        obliged to make all information available to Chef.one in full, without
        delay and truthfully in the event of claims by third parties insofar as
        this information is required for reviewing the claims and defense.
      </p>
      <p>Section 14 Data Protection</p>
      <p>
        Chef.one observes statutory requirements relating to the fulfillment of
        data protection law. The relevant provisions and declarations can be
        found <a href="https://chef.one/privacy">here</a> and at
        chef.one/privacy.

        <strong>Section 15 Information on Online Dispute Resolution</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          The EU Commission is to provide an online platform for online dispute
          resolution in early 2016 (known as the ODR platform).
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          The ODR platform serves to offer contractors and consumers a simple,
          efficient, fast, and cost-effective extrajudicial solution for
          disputes that arise from online transactions. The platform can be
          accessed at
        </strong>
        <a href="http://www.ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr">
          <strong>www.ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</strong>
        </a>
        <strong>.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Section 16 Final Provisions, Place of Jurisdiction, Applicable Law</p>
      <p>
        The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies to contracts between
        users and Chef.one to the exclusion of the UN Convention on Contracts
        for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). Statutory provisions on the
        restriction of governing law and the applicability of mandatory
        provisions, particularly of the country in which the customer (as
        consumer) habitually resides, remain unaffected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chef.one reserves the right to amend these TCs at any time without
        giving reasons. The amended terms and conditions shall be sent to users
        by email no later then four weeks before they enter into force. If no
        users object to the validity of the new TCs within three weeks of
        receipt of the email, the amended TCs shall be considered accepted.
        Chef.one shall separately notify users in the email that contains the
        amended terms and conditions of the opportunity to object and the
        significance of the revocation period in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the user is an enterprise, corporate body under public law, or a
        special fund under public law, the place of jurisdiction for all
        disputes arising from the contractual relationships between the customer
        and the provider shall be the registered office of Chef.one.
      </p>
      <p>
        The above place of jurisdiction is also agreed for cases in which the
        user does not have a general place of jurisdiction in Germany.
